<p>As an art director and designer, there’s nothing more fun than concepting and creating<br>inspiring IDEAS, BRAND STORIES and DESIGNS that entice, excite and elicit a response.</p>
<p>Whether working on-site or virtually,<br>I’m always exploring creative new ways to achieve our mutual success.</p>
<p>My vast experience in brand building and problem-solving<br>across many categories and media make me a quick study.</p>
<p>Being highly skilled in Adobe CS, CC, Topaz, MS and Mac Programs<br>allows me to generate dynamic, impactful and sale-able presentations.</p>
<p>For your next critical project, call me... The Lar Man.</p>
